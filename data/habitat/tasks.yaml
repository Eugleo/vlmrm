    You will be given five frames from a video depicting a first-person video reconstruction taken in a 3D model of a house. Important notes:
    - the frames are given to you in chronological order
    - due to compression and modelling issues, there might be some artifacts in the frames

    Your task is to describe what you see in each frame. Focus on general context and notable objects. Describe each frame separately.
